    Using tools from auction theory, optimization and game theory, I
    have shown that cooperative schemes are better suited to implement
    grid flexibility than their competitive counterpart. Moreover, I
    developed a framework for cooperative investments in energy storage
    that can increase the capacity of deployed energy storage by 200%
    with respect to scenarios without cooperation. I adapted my research
    to respond to the needs of our industrial partner, ENEDIS, who needs
    to position itself in the context of the new Smart Grid
    architectures.
