      Using tools from auction theory, optimization and game theory, I have
      shown that cooperative schemes are better suited to implement grid
      flexibility than their competitive counterpart. Moreover, I developed a
      framework for cooperative investments in energy storage that can
      increase the capacity of deployed energy storage by 200% with respect to
      scenarios without cooperation. I adapted my research to respond to the
      needs of our industrial partner, ENEDIS, who needs to position itself in
      the context of the new Smart Grid architectures.

      My research focused on Local Energy Markets in the context of the energy
      transition. I extended existing models using auction theory and
      reinforcement learning.
