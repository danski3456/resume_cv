      Using tools from auction theory, optimization and game theory, I have shown that cooperative schemes are better suited to implement grid flexibility than their competitive counterpart.
      Moreover, I developed a framework for cooperative investments in energy storage that can increase the capacity of deployed energy storage by 200% with respect to scenarios without cooperation.
      I adapted my research to respond to the needs of our industrial partner, ENEDIS, who needs to position itself in the context of the new Smart Grid architectures.
