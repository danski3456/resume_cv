      Mechanisms and architectures to encourage the massive and efficient use of local renewable energy. 
      During my PhD I used game theory to model energy prosumers that bid for their renewable energy
      in a local energy market implemented as a double-sided auction. Advisor: Prof. Daniel Kofman.

      I joined Cohort 4 to start a venture in climate change.
      As part of the program, I began Lantern Blue, the data ecosystem for blue carbon projects.
      I had to network extensively, pitch, build products, and sell during this time.
      We put our idea on hold after realizing that the market needs to mature.

      Using tools from auction theory, optimization and game theory, I have shown that cooperative schemes are better suited to implement grid flexibility than their competitive counterpart.
      Moreover, I developed a framework for cooperative investments in energy storage that can increase the capacity of deployed energy storage by 200% with respect to scenarios without cooperation.
      I adapted my research to respond to the needs of our industrial partner, ENEDIS, who needs to position itself in the context of the new Smart Grid architectures.
